    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook guides you through Azure AI Foundry's safety evaluators to ensure your AI application generates safe, appropriate content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Before deploying Cora to serve Zava customers, you must ensure it generates safe, appropriate content and is protected against adversarial attacks. This notebook guides you through Azure AI Foundry's safety evaluators, helping you identify and mitigate risks like harmful content, jailbreak attempts, and protected material violations to maintain a secure and trustworthy customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Learned about the built-in safety evaluators in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "- ✅ Understood risk and safety categories (hate, violence, sexual, self-harm, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ Run individual safety evaluators with test prompts\n",
    "- ✅ Used the Content Safety Evaluator for composite assessment\n",
    "- ✅ Analyzed safety evaluation results and defect rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- The built-in safety evaluators available in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "- How generation safety evaluation works with LLM-based evaluators\n",
    "- Risk categories: hateful content, sexual content, violent content, self-harm, protected material, jailbreak, code vulnerability, ungrounded attributes\n",
    "- How to run safety evaluators with your test dataset\n",
    "- How to interpret defect rates and severity scores\n",
