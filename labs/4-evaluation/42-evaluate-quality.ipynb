    "To build your own prompt-based large language model evaluator or AI-assisted annotator, you can create a custom evaluator based on a prompt template. [Learn more here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-evaluators/custom-evaluators). You can also create a custom grader using the Azure OpenAI grader with custom prompts.
