    "AI agents are powerful productivity assistants that can create complex workflows for business needs. However, observability can be a challenge due to their complex interaction patterns. Unlike simple query-response AI systems, agents involve multiple steps including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intent Recognition** - Understanding what the user wants to accomplish\n",
    "- **Tool Selection & Usage** - Choosing and correctly using available tools\n",
    "- **Task Execution** - Following through on the assigned workflow\n",
    "- **Response Generation** - Providing helpful and accurate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user queries \"What's the weather tomorrow?\", an agentic workflow might involve reasoning through user intents, calling weather APIs, and utilizing retrieval-augmented generation. In this process, it's crucial to evaluate each step of the workflow, plus the quality and safety of the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry provides specialized **agent evaluators** that assess these unique aspects of agentic workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Resolution** - Measures whether the agent correctly identifies the user's intent\n",
    "2. **Tool Call Accuracy** - Measures whether the agent made the correct function tool calls\n",
    "3. **Task Adherence** - Measures whether the agent's response adheres to its assigned tasks"

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully learned how to evaluate AI agents using Azure AI Foundry's specialized evaluators. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Resolution Evaluation** - Measured how well agents understand user intents\n",
    "2. **Tool Call Accuracy Assessment** - Evaluated correct tool selection and usage\n",
    "3. **Task Adherence Monitoring** - Ensured agents stay within their defined scope\n",
    "4. **Complex Agent Interactions** - Handled multi-step conversations and tool usage\n",
    "5. **Batch Evaluation Pipeline** - Created scalable evaluation workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights from Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent evaluators provide specialized metrics** for agentic workflows beyond simple query-response\n",
    "- **Binary pass/fail results** with detailed reasoning help identify specific improvement areas\n",
    "- **Tool evaluation** is crucial for agents that interact with external systems\n",
    "- **Task adherence** ensures agents maintain their intended purpose and boundaries\n",
    "- **Combining quality and safety evaluators** provides comprehensive agent assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Evaluation** - Set up automated evaluation pipelines for agent deployments\n",
    "2. **Threshold Monitoring** - Configure alerts when evaluation scores drop below acceptable levels\n",
    "3. **A/B Testing** - Compare different agent configurations using evaluation metrics\n",
    "4. **User Feedback Integration** - Combine automated evaluations with human feedback\n",
    "5. **Tool Coverage Testing** - Ensure all available tools are properly tested and evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** for building production agents\n",
    "- Implement **continuous evaluation** in your agent deployment pipeline  \n",
    "- Try the **Response Completeness Evaluator** for more comprehensive quality assessment\n",
    "- Set up **custom evaluators** for domain-specific agent requirements\n",
    "- Integrate with **Azure AI Foundry portal** for rich evaluation result visualization\n",
