    "# 🛍️ | Cora-For-Zava: Your First Evaluation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook sets up the Azure AI Evaluation SDK and walks you through your first evaluation with quality and safety evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Before deploying Cora to help customers, you need to ensure it provides accurate, safe, and helpful responses. Evaluation is the foundation of trust in AI applications, making it a critical part of the Generative AI Ops (GenAIOps) lifecycle. Without rigorous evaluation, Cora could produce content that is fabricated, irrelevant, harmful, or vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Run your first evaluation using the Azure AI Evaluation SDK\n",
    "- ✅ Configured and used built-in evaluators for quality and safety\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluated a test dataset with sample responses\n",
    "- ✅ Saved evaluation results to a file\n",
    "- ✅ Viewed evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry portal\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- What the `evaluate()` function does and how to use it\n",
    "- How to configure and run evaluations with built-in evaluators\n",
    "- How to interpret evaluation metrics\n",
    "- How to view results in the Azure AI Foundry portal\n",

    "## 📊 The Three Stages of GenAIOps Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Model Selection** - Compare models for accuracy, quality, safety and task performance\n",
    "2. **Pre-Production Evaluation** - Iterate on prototypes, assess robustness, validate edge cases\n",
    "3. **Post-Production Monitoring** - Track performance and ensure quality in real-world environments\n",

    "As you view the results, here are some things to consider:\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Are Cora's responses addressing the customer's actual questions about Zava products?\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Does Cora provide correct product information (SKUs, prices, stock levels)?\n",
    "- **Safety**: Are the responses free from potentially harmful content or inappropriate language?\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Does Cora provide enough detail to help customers make informed decisions?\n",
    "- **Product Knowledge**: Is Cora accurately representing the products available in the catalog?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Explore:\n",
    "- Which queries received the highest and lowest relevance scores?\n",
    "- Are there any safety concerns flagged in the responses?\n",
    "- How well does Cora handle different types of customer inquiries (product recommendations, comparisons, availability)?\n",
    "- What patterns emerge in responses that score poorly vs. well?\n",

    "We used a \"toy\" dataset with 5 example queries just to illustrate the process. In the real-world scenario, you want to use a test dataset that is representative of the types of queries your Zava customers will be asking - questions about paint types, tools, hardware, availability, pricing, and project recommendations. You can use the [Simulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ai-evaluation-readme?view=azure-python#simulator) to help you generate realistic test data for your retail chatbot evaluations. **We will look at that in a later lab!**"
