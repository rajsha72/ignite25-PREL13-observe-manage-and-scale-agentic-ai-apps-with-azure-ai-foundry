# PREL13: Learn how to observe, manage, and scale agentic AI apps using Azure

This hands-on workshop will provide participants with the skills to effectively manage, govern, and scale agentic AI applications using Azure and Azure AI Foundry. The session will cover observability capabilities, model management policies, agent functionalities, and governance strategies. Participants will engage in practical exercises to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

- **Level:** 300-400 
- **Duration:** 4 hours

## The End-to-End Journey

As a Zava AI Engineer, your journey has three main phases:
1. _Plan_ - select models, identify goals, generate datasets
2. _Develop_ - implement agents, customize models & evaluate outcomes
3. _Operate_ - deploy solution, monitor performance & iterate as needed

This _labs/_ folder contains notebooks with hands-on exercises that teach you key tools, features, and workflows, for this journey. Here's what you'll learn:

1. _Agent_Architecture_ - validate infrastructure · plan & create agents
1. _Model_Context_ - select models · plan & create datasets
1. _Model_Customization_ - define behaviors · fine-tune models to fit
1. _Evaluation_Metrics_ - response quality & safety · agent performance
1. _Tracing_Telemetry_ - setup observability · understand telemetry, spans
1. _Deployment_Insights_ - use developer tier · monitor performance

## Core Labs vs. More Labs

The [Outline](OUTLINE.md) describes in more detail, the application scenario and AI developer workflow for building solutions like this. The in-venue session only has 4 hours to complete the entire journey - **requiring us to be selective about what we can cover (from this list) within that time.**

With that in mind, we designed the workshop to ensure you would leave the session with a _personal copy_ of the repository that you can then use as a learning sandbox for self-guided experiments at home. The instruction guide will reflect this with two tracks:

1. **Core Labs** - in-venue · pre-provisioned subscription ·  instructor-led
1. **More Labs** - at-home · your Azure subscription ·  self-guided

We will focus on the _Core Labs_ and encourage you to revisit your fork of this repo at home later to explore the rest. Please to star and watch the original repo for updates - we will continue to add _More Labs_ content after Microsoft Ignite.

Ready? Let's Go! 🚀
