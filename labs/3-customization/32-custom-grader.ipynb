    "Distillation is about having a \"teacher\" model transfer its learning to a \"student\" model, thereby allowing it to perform a _narrower_ task with comparable accuracy. To understand if our distillation had the desired effect, we typically _grade_ the student model before and after distillation - and show that the grades on that task improved significantly.\n",
