    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, you'll create a **multi-agent system** that uses relevant tools to answer customer questions about products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. As Zava retail stores grow, Cora needs to handle more complex customer needs. This notebook shows you how to evolve from a single agent to a multi-agent system, with specialized agents for inventory management and customer service. You'll learn to orchestrate multiple agents working together to provide sophisticated and role-specific assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Two specialized agents for a hardware store:\n",
    "- **Product Inventory Agent** - Technical expert for product specs and stock levels\n",
    "- **Customer Service Agent** - Friendly helper for recommendations and guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Both agents will search the same product database but respond differently based on their role.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to connect agents to Azure AI Search\n",
    "- How to create agents with different personalities\n",

    "## 🎉 Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built a multi-agent system with Azure AI Search!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "✅ Connected agents to Azure AI Search  \n",
    "✅ Created specialized agents with different personalities  \n",
    "✅ Built a router to send questions to the right agent  \n",
    "✅ Streamed responses with search citations  \n",
    "✅ Tested with real product queries  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **AIProjectClient** - Manages your Azure AI project and connections\n",
    "- **Agent Creation** - Use `create_agent()` with search tool configuration\n",
    "- **ChatAgent Wrapper** - Provides streaming and citation collection\n",
    "- **Tool Resources** - Configure which search index each agent uses\n",
    "- **Instructions** - Shape agent behavior and personality\n",
    "- **Router Pattern** - Automatically route questions to the best agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Router Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You ask** → \"What interior paint do you recommend for my bedroom?\"\n",
    "2. **Router analyzes** → Sees keywords like \"recommend\" and \"use for\"\n",
    "3. **Picks agent** → Routes to Customer Service Agent\n",
    "4. **Agent searches** → Queries the `zava-products` index\n",
    "5. **Gets results** → Azure AI Search returns matching products\n",
    "6. **Agent responds** → Formats answer based on its personality\n",
    "7. **You see** → Friendly response with product suggestions and citations\n",
    "\n",
    "Both agents use the **same product database** but respond **differently** based on their instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Modify agent instructions to change their behavior\n",
    "- Try different search query types (semantic, vector, hybrid)\n",
    "- Add more specialized agents (e.g., Returns Agent, Shipping Agent)\n",
    "- Build a more sophisticated router with AI-based routing\n",
    "- Add conversation memory so agents remember past questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn More\n",
    "- [Agent Framework Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/)\n",
