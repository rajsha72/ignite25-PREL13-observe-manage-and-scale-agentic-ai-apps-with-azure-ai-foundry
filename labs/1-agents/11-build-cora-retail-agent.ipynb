    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **AI agent** is like hiring a specialized AI assistant that combines three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Components:**\n",
    "- **Instructions** - Defines how the agent behaves and responds (personality, tone, role)\n",
    "- **Model** - Identifies the LLM (e.g., gpt-4.1) that provides intelligence with NLP\n",
    "- **Tools** - Capabilities it can use (code execution, file search, function calling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Workflow:**\n",
    "- **Threads** - A conversation session (like a chat room for one customer)\n",
    "- **Messages** - Individual messages in the conversation (questions and answers)\n",
    "- **Runs** - When the agent processes messages and generates responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows how these components work together, using a finance chatbot example from the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/threads-runs-messages). We can easily see how the same patterns apply to our retail chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](./../assets/01-run-thread-model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer sends a message:\n",
    "1. The **message** is added to a **thread** (conversation session)\n",
    "2. A **run** is created to process the message\n",
    "3. The agent uses its **instructions**, **model**, and **tools** to generate a response\n",
    "4. The response is returned to the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's create Cora! 🎉"

    "## 🎓 Step 16: What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congratulations!** 🎉 You've successfully built Cora-For-Zava, a fully functional AI retail agent with grounded knowledge!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Agent Service** ✅\n",
    "   - Connected to Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "   - Used the AIProjectClient to manage agents\n",
    "   - Authenticated with DefaultAzureCredential\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Creation** ✅\n",
    "   - Created an agent with personality and instructions\n",
    "   - Configured model deployment\n",
    "   - Defined helpful customer service behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Upload and Vector Stores** ✅\n",
    "   - Uploaded product files to Azure\n",
    "   - Created a vector store for semantic search\n",
    "   - Indexed product documents for retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **File Search Tool** ✅\n",
    "   - Configured file search tool with vector store\n",
    "   - Updated agent to use file search capabilities\n",
    "   - Enabled grounded responses from actual documents\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conversation Management** ✅\n",
    "   - Created threads for organized conversations\n",
    "   - Sent and received messages\n",
    "   - Maintained conversation context across multiple turns\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Agent Execution** ✅\n",
    "   - Ran the agent to process messages\n",
    "   - Agent automatically searched through product files\n",
    "   - Retrieved and displayed responses\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Real-World Application** ✅\n",
    "   - Grounded agent in actual product data\n",
    "   - Answered customer questions with accurate information\n",
    "   - Provided details about prices, stock, warranties, and policies\n",
    "   - Maintained professional, friendly tone\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes Cora Special\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grounded Knowledge**: Responses are based on actual product documents, not hallucinations\n",
    "- **Memory**: Remembers conversation context across multiple questions\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Can find relevant information across multiple product files\n",
    "- **Personality**: Friendly, helpful, and professional customer service style\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Handles various question types (product details, prices, warranties, policies)\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Can handle more product files by simply uploading them to the vector store\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer Question\n",
    "      ↓\n",
    "   Message → Thread\n",
    "      ↓\n",
    "   Agent → File Search Tool → Vector Store → Product Files\n",
    "      ↓\n",
    "   AI Model (GPT-4o)\n",
    "      ↓\n",
    "   Grounded Response\n",
    "      ↓\n",
    "   Customer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **file search with vector stores**, Cora can provide accurate, grounded responses based on actual product documentation. This is much more reliable than relying on the model's general knowledge, which can lead to hallucinations or outdated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebooks, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Add custom functions for real-time inventory checks\n",
    "- Implement product recommendations\n",
    "- Handle complex multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- Deploy Cora to production\n",
    "- Monitor and improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! You're now ready to build more sophisticated AI agents! 🚀"

    "## 🚀 Step 16: Next Steps - Production Readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on building Cora! Now let's explore how to enhance and prepare your agent for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Try These Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to production, try these hands-on exercises to deepen your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify Instructions** - Make Cora more technical or adjust her personality\n",
    "2. **Expand Product Catalog** - Add more product files from different categories\n",
    "3. **Create Variations** - Build a second agent with a different personality\n",
    "4. **Multi-Agent Systems** - Design sales and support agents that work together\n",
    "5. **Export Conversations** - Add functionality to save conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from prototype to production requires careful attention to three critical areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Evaluation & Testing** 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying Cora, you need to measure her performance:\n",
    "- **Create test datasets** with real customer scenarios\n",
    "- **Measure accuracy** using evaluation metrics (groundedness, relevance, coherence)\n",
    "- **A/B test different instructions** to find the most effective approach\n",
    "- **Automated testing** to catch regressions before they reach customers\n",
    "\n",
    "**📘 Learn More**: In the next lab on **Model Evaluation**, you'll learn how to systematically test Cora's responses using Azure AI Foundry's evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Tracing & Observability** 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what happens during agent execution is critical:\n",
    "- **Add tracing** with Azure Application Insights\n",
    "- **Track conversation metrics** (response time, token usage, success rates)\n",
    "- **Monitor response quality** and detect anomalies\n",
    "- **Debug issues** by examining detailed execution traces\n",
    "\n",
    "**📘 Learn More**: The **Tracing & Observability** lab will show you how to instrument Cora with comprehensive monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Model Customization** 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the base model needs fine-tuning for your specific use case:\n",
    "- **Fine-tune models** on your domain-specific data\n",
    "- **Improve accuracy** for specialized product knowledge\n",
    "- **Reduce costs** by using smaller, customized models\n",
    "- **Knowledge distillation** to transfer capabilities from larger to smaller models\n",
    "\n",
    "**📘 Learn More**: The **Model Customization** lab covers fine-tuning techniques and when to apply them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Additional Production Needs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety & Content Filtering** - Use Azure AI Content Safety and prompt shields\n",
    "- **Scaling** - Handle concurrent users with optimized response times\n",
    "- **Security** - Implement proper authentication and data protection\n",
    "- **Deployment** - Use Azure Container Apps or other hosting options\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built a solid foundation with Cora. The following labs will help you:\n",
    "- ✅ **Evaluate** - Measure and improve response quality\n",
    "- ✅ **Trace** - Monitor and debug agent behavior  \n",
    "- ✅ **Customize** - Fine-tune models for your specific needs\n",
    "- ✅ **Deploy** - Move your agent to production\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these topics builds on what you've learned here. Let's keep going! 🚀"
