    "# 🛍️ | Cora-For-Zava: Introduction to OpenTelemetry and Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook provides beginner-friendly explanations of key observability concepts you'll encounter when working with AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. To ensure Cora provides reliable service in production, we need to observe and monitor how it processes customer requests, calls tools, and generates responses. This introduction helps you understand the fundamental concepts of OpenTelemetry and distributed tracing before diving into hands-on agent tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- What OpenTelemetry is and why it matters\n",
    "- Core tracing concepts: traces, spans, and attributes\n",
    "- How tracing applies to AI agents like Cora\n",
    "- GenAI semantic conventions for standardized telemetry\n",
    "- How to think about observability in agentic workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the hands-on agent tracing notebooks, understanding these concepts will help you:\n",
    "- Instrument your AI applications effectively\n",
    "- Troubleshoot issues in production\n",
    "- Understand performance bottlenecks\n",
    "- Monitor agent behavior and tool usage\n",

    "## What is OpenTelemetry?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework for collecting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) from your applications. Think of it as a standardized way to answer: \"What is my application doing right now, and how is it performing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key benefits:**\n",
    "- **Vendor-neutral**: Works with many monitoring tools, not locked to one provider\n",
    "- **Standardized**: Uses common terminology and data formats\n",
    "- **Built-in**: Supported natively in modern cloud platforms like Azure"

    "## Core Tracing Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Trace\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trace** represents the complete journey of a single request through your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When a customer asks Cora \"What paint do you have?\", the trace captures:\n",
    "- The customer's question arriving\n",
    "- The agent deciding which tools to call\n",
    "- Each tool execution (product lookup, inventory check)\n",
    "- The final response generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a trace as the full story of one customer interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Span\n",
    "\n",
    "A **span** is a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested (parent-child relationships) to show how work flows through your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example spans in the agent notebooks:**\n",
    "- `zava_customer_session` - The overall customer interaction (parent span)\n",
    "- `invoke_agent` - Agent processing the request (child span)\n",
    "- `execute_tool: get_product_info` - Looking up product details (child span)\n",
    "- `execute_tool: calculate_discount` - Computing discount (child span)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: If a trace is a recipe, spans are the individual steps (preheat oven, mix ingredients, bake).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** are key-value pairs that provide context about what happened in a span.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples from the agent notebooks:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"user.request\", \"What paint do you have?\")\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"customer.tier\", \"gold\")\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"agent.name\", \"Cora\")\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"gen_ai.request.model\", \"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes let you filter and analyze traces: \"Show me all failed requests from Gold tier customers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Trace ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Every trace gets a unique identifier (TraceID). This lets you:\n",
    "- Find all spans belonging to one customer interaction\n",
    "- Correlate logs and metrics with traces\n",
    "- Debug specific issues by trace ID"

    "## Azure AI Foundry Tracing Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry provides specialized tracing for AI agents with these capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Instrumentation\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor().instrument()`, the framework automatically captures:\n",
    "- **Agent creation**: Model, instructions, tools configured\n",
    "- **Agent invocations**: User messages, system prompts, reasoning steps\n",
    "- **Tool executions**: Which tools were called, with what parameters, what they returned\n",
    "- **Model calls**: Token usage, latency, responses\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to manually create spans for these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GenAI Semantic Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenTelemetry defines standard attribute names for AI applications. The agent notebooks use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For agents:**\n",
    "- `gen_ai.provider.name` - Which AI provider (e.g., \"azure.ai.openai\")\n",
    "- `gen_ai.request.model` - Model name (e.g., \"gpt-4o-mini\")\n",
    "- `agent.name` - Agent identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**For operations:**\n",
    "- `user.request` - Customer's question\n",
    "- `agent.response` - Agent's answer\n",
    "- `request.success` - Did it work (true/false)\n",
    "\n",
    "These conventions ensure your traces are readable across different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Insights Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Insights** is Azure's monitoring service. When you configure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING = \"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your traces automatically flow to Azure Monitor where you can:\n",
    "- **Search traces**: Find specific customer interactions\n",
    "- **Build dashboards**: Visualize agent performance over time\n",
    "- **Set alerts**: Get notified when errors spike\n",
    "- **Analyze trends**: Track response times, tool usage patterns"

    "## How Tracing Helps You\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "When something goes wrong, traces show you exactly what happened:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer asked about paint\n",
    "  ✓ Agent invoked successfully\n",
    "  ✓ Tool: get_product_info(\"PFIP000002\") → Found product\n",
    "  ✗ Tool: calculate_discount(\"gold\", 200) → Error: Invalid tier format\n",
    "  ✗ Agent failed to generate response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the tool call failed and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Traces show how long each operation takes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total request: 2.3 seconds\n",
    "  - Agent reasoning: 0.8 seconds\n",
    "  - Tool: get_product_info: 0.1 seconds\n",
    "  - Tool: check_inventory: 1.2 seconds ← SLOW!\n",
    "  - Response generation: 0.2 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know to optimize the inventory check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Understanding Agent Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Traces reveal how your agent makes decisions:\n",
    "- Which tools does it call most often?\n",
    "- Does it call tools in the right order?\n",
    "- Are some tools never used?\n",
    "- How does it handle ambiguous questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you refine instructions and tool configurations."

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Descriptive Span Names\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good\n",
    "with tracer.start_as_current_span(\"calculate_gold_tier_discount\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less helpful\n",
    "with tracer.start_as_current_span(\"calc\"):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add Meaningful Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good - provides context\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"customer.tier\", \"gold\")\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"cart.value\", 200.0)\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"discount.amount\", 30.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Less useful\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"data\", \"some value\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Don't Log Sensitive Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad - contains PII\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"customer.email\", \"john@example.com\")\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"customer.credit_card\", \"1234-5678...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good - use IDs\n",
    "span.set_attribute(\"customer.id\", \"cust_12345\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Set Trace Sampling for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you may not want to trace every request (too much data). Configure sampling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Trace 10% of requests\n",
    "sampler = TraceIdRatioBased(0.1)\n",
    "```"
