# Lab 6: Deployment & Insights

Deploy your agentic AI application and monitor its performance in production using Azure AI Foundry's developer tier and monitoring tools.

## Description

Learn to deploy agents to production environments, configure monitoring, and gain insights into real-world performance using Azure AI Foundry's deployment features.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- ✅ Deploy agents using Azure AI Foundry developer tier
- ✅ Configure production monitoring and alerts
- ✅ Analyze real-time performance metrics
- ✅ Implement cost tracking and optimization
- ✅ Set up scaling policies for varying loads

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed [Lab 5: Tracing & Telemetry](../5-tracing/)
- ✅ Agents tested and evaluated
- ✅ Production readiness checklist completed

## Key Concepts

### Developer Tier Deployment
Quick deployment for testing and development:
- Managed infrastructure
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in monitoring

### Production Monitoring
