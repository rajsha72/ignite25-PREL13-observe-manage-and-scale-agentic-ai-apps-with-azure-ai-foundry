# Core Labs

!!! info "Welcome to Core Labs"
    These hands-on exercises are designed to be completed during the in-venue instructor-led workshop session. They provide foundational knowledge and practical experience in building, evaluating, and deploying agentic AI applications on Azure AI Foundry.
    
## 1. Application Scenario

!!! quote ""
    This hands-on scenario covers the complete workflow: prototype, evaluate, customize, monitor, and deploy. See the [Workshop Outline](outline.md) for how each lab connects to this scenario.


You'll build **Cora**, an AI shopping assistant for Zava, a home improvement retailer. Cora helps customers by answering questions about products, checking inventory, and sharing available discounts.

**Your goals:**

- Build an agent that retrieves accurate product information
- Test different models to find the right balance of quality and cost
- Fine-tune responses to match the brand's helpful, polite tone
- Add tracing to monitor performance and debug issues
- Deploy the solution to production
