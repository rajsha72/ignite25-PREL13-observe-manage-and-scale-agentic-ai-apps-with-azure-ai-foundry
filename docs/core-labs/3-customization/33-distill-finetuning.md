# Distillation Fine-tuning

Learn to use model distillation to create cost-efficient models that maintain quality while reducing operational costs.

## Description

Explore model distillation by using a larger, more capable model's outputs to train a smaller, faster, and more cost-effective model.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand model distillation concepts
- Generate training data from larger models
- Fine-tune smaller models with distilled knowledge
- Compare performance and cost tradeoffs

## Instructions
