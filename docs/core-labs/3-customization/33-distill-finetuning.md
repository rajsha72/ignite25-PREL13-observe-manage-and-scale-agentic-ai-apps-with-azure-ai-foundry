# Lab 3.3: Distillation Fine-tuning

!!! info "Objective"
    Learn to use model distillation to create cost-efficient models that maintain quality while reducing operational costs.

## 1. Description

Explore model distillation by using a larger, more capable "teacher" model's outputs to train a smaller, faster, and more cost-effective "student" model. Distillation enables knowledge transfer from expensive models to efficient ones, achieving significant cost and performance improvements while maintaining quality standards for specialized tasks.

## 2. Scenario

**Cora is using GPT-4** for excellent customer service quality, but the costs are high for Zava's scale. You'll implement model distillation to transfer Cora's specialized knowledge from GPT-4 (teacher) to GPT-4.1-nano (student). This process captures GPT-4's stored completions, uses them as training data, and fine-tunes the smaller model to achieve comparable quality at a fraction of the cost and latency.

## 3. Instructions

!!! lab "NOTEBOOK: Distillation Fine-tuning"

    **📓 Open:** [`labs/3-customization/33-distill-finetuning.ipynb`](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-PDY123-learn-how-to-observe-manage-and-scale-agentic-ai-apps-using-azure/blob/main/labs/3-customization/33-distill-finetuning.ipynb)
    
    **🚀 Run the notebook:**
    
    1. Select the Python kernel when prompted
    2. Clear all outputs (optional, for a clean start)
    3. Run all cells sequentially

**What you'll learn in this lab:**

1. Understand teacher-student architecture and knowledge transfer concepts in model distillation
2. Configure distillation pipelines using Azure AI Foundry evaluation and fine-tuning services
3. Use custom graders to measure baseline and distilled model performance
4. Generate training data from teacher model completions for student model learning
5. Compare cost, speed, and quality tradeoffs between different model sizes

## 4. Ask Copilot
