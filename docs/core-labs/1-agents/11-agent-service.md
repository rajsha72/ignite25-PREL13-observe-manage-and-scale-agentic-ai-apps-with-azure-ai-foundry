# Build Cora Retail Agent

## 1. Objective

Learn how to build an intelligent customer service agent using Azure AI Agent Service's managed infrastructure. This lab covers agent creation, conversation management with threads, and integrating product search capabilities for Zava's hardware retail business.

## 2. Scenario

Cora is Zava's AI customer service representative who helps customers find the right hardware products, check inventory, and receive personalized assistance for home improvement projects. This lab establishes the foundation for Cora by creating the agent, configuring its personality, and setting up conversation threads to maintain customer interaction history across multiple turns.

## 3. Instructions

!!! lab "NOTEBOOK: Build Cora Retail Agent"

    **📓 Open:** [`labs/1-agents/11-build-cora-retail-agent.ipynb`](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-PDY123-learn-how-to-observe-manage-and-scale-agentic-ai-apps-using-azure/blob/main/labs/1-agents/11-build-cora-retail-agent.ipynb)
    
    **🚀 Run the notebook:**
    
    1. Select the Python kernel when prompted
    1. Clear all outputs (optional, for a clean start)
    1. Run all cells sequentially
    1. Read through explainers to understand outputs
    1. **Troubleshooting:** If cells fail to execute or hang for more than 2-3 minutes, reload your browser tab/codespace and reopen the notebook to try again
    1. Close the notebook once done

**What you'll learn in this lab:**

1. Load environment variables and verify Azure AI Foundry project connection
2. Create Cora agent with instructions defining personality and role
3. Load Zava's product catalog for agent knowledge
4. Create conversation threads to manage customer interactions
5. Test Cora with sample customer queries about hardware products

## 4. Ask Copilot

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Azure AI Agent Service provides managed infrastructure for building conversational AI agents with persistent conversation state
- Threads enable multi-turn conversations by maintaining message history automatically, allowing agents to reference previous interactions
- Agents are stateless orchestrators that combine instructions, tools, and model capabilities to respond intelligently to user queries
